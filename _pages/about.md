I’m a first-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn).
My research interests include AI4DB, large language models, and database systems.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof.[Yinjun Wu](https://wuyinjun-1993.github.io). Before that, I obtained my bachelor’s degree from the [School of Computer Science & Technology](https://cs.bit.edu.cn), [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn) in 2025.
